## 2. Capstone Project Setup Checklist

Use this checklist when setting up your actual capstone project. Each team member should complete these steps.

### Repository Setup

- [ ] **Create a new GitHub repository** for your capstone
  - One team member creates the repo
  - Others are added as collaborators (Settings → Collaborators)
  - Add `lontok` as a collaborator (your instructor)
  - Choose a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `capstone-inventory-system`)

- [ ] **Initialize the repository** with:
  - README.md with project description
  - .gitignore for your tech stack
  - LICENSE if applicable

- [ ] **Clone the repository** to your local machine using Cursor

   1. On your repository page on GitHub, click the green **Code** button
   2. Make sure **HTTPS** is selected and copy the URL
   3. Open Cursor → **File** → **New Window**
   4. Click **Clone Repo**
   5. Paste the repository URL and press **Enter/Return**
   6. Choose a location (e.g., your `GitHub` folder)
   7. Click **Open** when prompted

### Jira Setup (For Teams)

One team member creates the Jira project, then invites the rest of the team.

- [ ] **Create a shared Jira project**

   1. Use your existing Atlassian account (or create one at [atlassian.com](https://www.atlassian.com/))
   2. Access Jira by clicking the **menu icon** (four squares) in the top left, then click **Jira**
   3. In the left sidebar, click the **+** next to **Spaces** to create a new space
   4. For the space template, select **Software Development** on the left, then click **Use Template**
   5. When asked how your space is managed, select **Team-managed space**
   6. Name your project something descriptive and meaningful (e.g., `Inventory Management System`)
   7. Click **Show more** on the bottom left to set the **Project key** — this is important because you'll reference Jira issues by key and number (e.g., `INV-1`, `INV-2`)
   8. If prompted to connect to Confluence, skip this — we'll save documentation in GitHub
   9. If prompted to invite team members, you can add them now (see below) or do it later

   **After setup**, you'll see your board with three columns: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. Click **Backlog** (tab to the left of "Board") — this is where Jira issues created via Claude Code will appear.

- [ ] **Invite team members** ([Atlassian docs](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/add-people-to-team-managed-projects/))

   1. Next to your project name in the sidebar, click **More actions** (•••), then **Project settings**
   2. Select **Access**
   3. Click **Add people**
   4. Enter team members' email addresses (the ones they used for Atlassian)
   5. Set their role to **Member**

- [ ] **Connect Claude Code to your new Jira project**
  - Each team member must connect the Atlassian MCP to the new project
  - Follow the same steps from [Section 1 of the tutorial](04-session-2-workflow.md#1-connect-claude-code-to-jira): run `/mcp`, select **atlassian**, and authenticate
  - This time you'll be connecting to your capstone Jira project instead of the tutorial project

### Development Environment

- [ ] **Each team member** should have:
  - Cursor installed with Claude Code
  - Git configured with their name/email
  - Python 3.11+ (if using Python)
  - uv and spec-kit installed
  - Access to the shared Jira project

- [ ] **Create initial project structure**
  - Ask Claude Code to help set up a standard structure
  - Create requirements.txt or package.json
  - Set up virtual environment

### Spec-Kit Initialization

- [ ] **Initialize spec-kit** in your capstone repo. In the terminal:
  ```bash
  specify init . --ai claude
  ```

---

## 3. Update Your PRD

In the tutorial, you used a provided PRD. For your capstone, you'll revise the PRD you submitted last semester.

**Copy your existing PRD** to the `prd/` folder in your repo. This gives Claude Code access to your current requirements, and you'll pass it to the `/speckit.specify` command later to generate your technical specification.

### Organize Your Notes

To help you update your PRD, create a `notes/` directory in your repo to collect:

- Meeting notes with your team or sponsor
- Your own thoughts and ideas
- Meeting transcripts or AI-generated meeting summaries
- Feedback from stakeholders

```
your-capstone-repo/
├── notes/
│   ├── sponsor-meeting-01.md
│   ├── team-brainstorm.md
│   └── feedback-summary.md
├── prd/
│   └── your-project-name.md    ← Copy your existing PRD here
├── specs/                       ← spec-kit will create this
└── ...
```

### Updating Your PRD with Claude Code

Use Claude Code and reference your PRD and notes using the `@` symbol:

```
Review @prd/your-project-name.md and update it based on @notes/sponsor-meeting-01.md and @notes/team-brainstorm.md

Make sure the PRD includes:
- Problem statement
- Target users
- Key features with acceptance criteria
- Technical constraints
```

You can also reference the entire notes directory:

```
Review @prd/your-project-name.md and @notes/ and help me update my PRD with the key requirements discussed.
```

### What a PRD Should Include

1. **Problem Statement** — What problem are you solving? Why does it matter?
2. **Target Users** — Who will use this? What are their needs?
3. **Features** — What will the solution do? (Be specific)
4. **Acceptance Criteria** — How do you know each feature is "done"?
5. **Constraints** — Technology requirements, timeline, team size

## 4. Spec-Kit Workflow for Capstone

Follow the same spec-kit workflow you learned in the tutorial:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 Spec-Kit Workflow                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  1. Constitution    → Project principles and standards      │
│         ↓                                                   │
│  2. Specification   → What to build (from your PRD)         │
│         ↓                                                   │
│  3. Plan            → How to build it (technical approach)  │

│  4. Tasks           → Atomic work items                     │
│         ↓                                                   │
│  5. Jira Issues     → Create issues from tasks              │
│         ↓                                                   │
│  6. Implement       → Build with /speckit.implement         │
│         ↓                                                   │
│  7. Commit & Push   → Save and share your work              │
│         ↓                                                   │
│  8. Update Jira     → Add evidence, move to Done            │
│                                                             │
│  (Repeat 6-8 for each issue)                                │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step-by-Step

1. **Create constitution** — Define your project's coding standards and principles:
   ```
   /speckit.constitution
   ```

2. **Create specification** — Convert your PRD into a technical specification:
   ```
   /speckit.specify @prd/your-project-name.md
   ```

3. **Create plan** — Generate an implementation plan:
   ```
   /speckit.plan
   ```

4. **Generate tasks** — Break the plan into atomic tasks:
   ```
   /speckit.tasks
   ```

5. **Create Jira issues** — Use Claude Code to create issues from your tasks:
   ```
   Create Jira issues from @specs/[your-spec]/tasks.md
   ```

6. **Implement** — Work through issues one at a time:
   ```
   /speckit.implement

   Implement [ISSUE-KEY] and move it to In Progress in Jira.
   ```

7. **Commit and push** — After completing the implementation:
   ```
   Commit my changes for [ISSUE-KEY] and push to GitHub.
   ```

8. **Update Jira** — Add evidence and mark the issue complete:
   ```
   Update [ISSUE-KEY] in Jira with a comment summarizing what was implemented,
   the commit hash, branch name, and GitHub link. Move it to Done.
   ```

Repeat steps 6-8 for each issue.

## 5. Team Workflow

When working as a team, the workflow expands slightly:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Team Workflow                             │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  1. Pick up a Jira issue (assign to yourself)               │
│                 ↓                                           │
│  2. Create a feature branch                                 │
│     feature/PROJ-123-description                            │
│                 ↓                                           │
│  3. Build with Claude Code                                  │
│                 ↓                                           │
│  4. Commit with Jira key                                    │
│     "PROJ-123: add user login"                              │
│                 ↓                                           │
│  5. Push to GitHub                                          │
│                 ↓                                           │
│  6. Update Jira with evidence                               │
│     (commit hash, branch, GitHub link)                      │
│                 ↓                                           │
│  7. Merge to main and move Jira issue to Done               │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Avoiding Conflicts

When multiple people work on the same codebase, coordination is key:

1. **Assign yourself to a Jira issue before starting** — This signals to teammates that you're working on it. Only one person should be assigned to an issue at a time.

2. **Check the Jira board before picking up work** — Make sure no one else is already working on the issue or a related feature.

3. **Work on separate files when possible** — Coordinate with your team so you're not editing the same files simultaneously.

4. **Pull from main frequently** — Before starting new work and before merging, pull the latest changes:
   ```
   Pull the latest changes from main into my branch
   ```

5. **Push your work regularly** — Don't wait until everything is perfect. Frequent pushes help the team see what's changing.

6. **Communicate** — Use your team chat to announce when you're starting and finishing work on an issue.

---

## 6. What to Submit

**Due: January 28** — Submit the following to Brightspace under the **Capstone Project Development Environment** assignment:

1. **GitHub repository link** — Your team's repo URL (e.g., `https://github.com/team/capstone-project`)

2. **Jira board screenshot** — Screenshot of your Jira board showing:
   - Your project name and key
   - The board columns (To Do, In Progress, Done)

3. **PRD file screenshot** — Screenshot showing your PRD file exists in the `prd/` folder of your repository

---

## 7. Best Practices for Capstone Success

### Use Branches Consistently

**Never commit directly to main.** Always:

1. Create a feature branch from main
2. Do your work on the branch
3. Merge to main when complete

This prevents conflicts and keeps main stable.

### Keep Jira Updated

- **Move cards** as work progresses (To Do → In Progress → Done)
- **Add evidence** when completing issues (implementation summary, commit hash, branch, GitHub link)
- **Add comments** when you encounter blockers
- **Link related issues** if they depend on each other

This keeps the whole team informed and creates traceability.

### Commit Often, Push Regularly

- **Commit** when you complete a logical unit of work
- **Push** at least once per work session
- This creates backup and enables collaboration

### Communicate with Your Team

- **Daily standups** — What did you do? What will you do? Any blockers?
- **Slack/Teams** — Quick questions and updates

### Use Claude Code Effectively

Claude Code is most helpful when you:

1. **Provide context** — Tell it about your project and constraints
2. **Ask specific questions** — "How do I..." not "Fix this"
3. **Iterate** — Build on Claude's suggestions
4. **Verify** — Don't blindly accept generated code
5. **Learn** — Ask Claude to explain what it did

---

## 8. Common Capstone Patterns

### Working on a Jira Issue

After completing the spec-kit setup (steps 1-5 in [Section 4](#4-spec-kit-workflow-for-capstone)), work through each issue:

1. **Pick a Jira issue** and assign it to yourself
2. **Implement** using `/speckit.implement`:
   ```
   /speckit.implement

   Implement PROJ-123 and move it to In Progress in Jira.
   ```
3. **Commit and push**:
   ```
   Commit my changes for PROJ-123 and push to GitHub
   ```
4. **Update Jira** with evidence:
   ```
   Update PROJ-123 in Jira with a comment summarizing what was implemented,
   the commit hash, branch name, and GitHub link. Move it to Done.
   ```

Repeat steps 1-4 for each issue. When all issues are complete, merge your feature branch to main:
```
Merge my branch to main and push
```

> **Tip:** Claude Code handles the git commands for you. Just describe what you want in plain English.

### Handling Merge Conflicts

When you see "This branch has conflicts", ask Claude Code for help:

```
Help me resolve the merge conflicts with main
```

Claude Code will fetch the latest changes, identify conflicts, and guide you through resolving them.

<details>
<summary>Traditional git commands (for reference)</summary>

```bash
# 1. Get latest main
git fetch origin

# 2. Merge main into your branch
git merge origin/main

# 3. If conflicts, ask Claude for help
# "Help me resolve merge conflicts in src/app.py"

# 4. After resolving
git add .
git commit -m "PROJ-123: resolve merge conflicts"
git push
```

</details>

### Debugging with Claude Code

When something breaks:

```
I'm seeing this error: [paste error]

The relevant code is in [filename].

What's causing this and how do I fix it?
```

Claude can read your code and provide specific solutions.

## 9. Capstone Resources

### Documentation to Create

- [ ] **README.md** — Project overview, setup instructions, team members
- [ ] **CONTRIBUTING.md** — How to contribute, coding standards
- [ ] **Architecture doc** — System design, component overview

### Tools to Consider

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **GitHub Projects** | Kanban board integrated with GitHub |
| **GitHub Actions** | Automated testing on every push |
| **Figma** | UI/UX design and prototyping |
| **Notion** | Team wiki and documentation |

### Getting Help

- **Claude Code** — First line of defense for technical issues
- **Team members** — Pair programming, code reviews
- **Instructor** — Office hours for complex problems
- **Online resources** — Stack Overflow, documentation

### Deployment Options

The tutorial used Streamlit Community Cloud, but your capstone may use different technology:

| Technology | Deployment Options |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Streamlit** | Streamlit Community Cloud (free) |
| **Flask/Django** | Heroku, Railway, Render, AWS |
| **React/Vue** | Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages |
| **API only** | Heroku, Railway, AWS Lambda |

Ask Claude Code for help with deployment:
```
Help me deploy my [Flask/React/etc.] app. What are my options?
```

> **Key principle:** Merge your feature branch to `main` before deploying. Most deployment platforms deploy from the `main` branch.

---

## 10. Final Reminders

1. **Start with the PRD** — Know what you are building before coding

2. **Use spec-kit** — Plan before you implement

3. **Keep Jira current** — Move cards, add evidence when done (commit hash, GitHub link)

4. **Commit with Jira keys** — Traceability matters

5. **Review each other's code** — Fresh eyes catch bugs

6. **Ask Claude for help** — It's there to make you more productive

7. **Have fun** — You are building something real with industry tools
